                <p>You get one site per GitHub account. 
			To get started, create a new repository named username.github.io, 
			where username is your Github username.</p>
		
		<p>You don't need to use HTML and CSS, but you will get a lot more control by doing so. </p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is an
                effective way to apply your skills to various projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another layout, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across oceans and borders, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of event.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                code skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>

                <h2>What is CSC 493?</h2>
		<p> Students apply modern software engineering approaches to the development of an original, well-documented, 
		software product. The product deliverables will include a product proposal, a specifications and requirements document, 
		an architecture and design document, a test plan document, project status reports, 
			and the code base implementation with quality documentation. Students will demonstrate their
			understanding by presenting and demonstrating the structure and applied elements of their project. 
			Students will need to apply technical, organizational, and communication skills to this project. 
			Successful completion of this course will meet Berea's Computer and Information Science Major 
			capstone requirement.</p>
