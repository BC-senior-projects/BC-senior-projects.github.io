		<p>Ready to learn about version control through git? </p>

                <h2>Version control is...</h2>

                <p>A way of keeping track of changes to a project so that if something needs to be rolled back to an older version that can be done.</p>
                
                <p>It is often used when you have multiple people working on the same project so that the correct changes can be pulled into the project.</p>

                <h2>Cloning a repository...</h2>

		<p>... is the process in which you copy a folder from Github into your personal computer. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)">The Clone Wars</a>, that is.</p>

                <h2>"Adding", "committing" and "pushing" changes...</h2>

		<p>... you just said three things that all mean the same thing.</p>

                <h2>You need to fork when...</h2>
                <p>...You would like to take a project in a direction
                 which may not be suitable for or in agreement with
                 the project's initial intention.</p>

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is an
                effective way to apply your skills to various projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another layout, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across oceans and borders, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of event.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                code skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
